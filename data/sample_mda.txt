"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe operate in two business segments: Funeral Home Operations, which currently accounts for approximately 70% of our total revenue and Cemetery Operations, which currently accounts for approximately 30% of our total revenue. At December 31, 2023, we operated 171 funeral homes in 26 states and 32 cemeteries in 11 states.\nOur funeral home operations are principally service businesses that generate revenue from sales of burial and cremation services and related merchandise, such as caskets and urns. Funeral services include consultation, the removal and preparation of remains, the sale of caskets and related funeral merchandise, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation and memorial services and transportation services. We provide funeral services and products on both an “atneed” (time of death) and “preneed” (planned prior to death) basis.\nOur cemetery operations generate revenue primarily through sales of cemetery interment rights (primarily grave sites, lawn crypts, mausoleum spaces and niches), related cemetery merchandise (such as memorial markers, outer burial containers and monuments) and services (interments, inurnments and installation of cemetery merchandise). We provide cemetery services and products on both an atneed and preneed basis.\nFuneral Home Operations\nFactors affecting our funeral operating results include: demographic trends relating to population growth and average age, which impact death rates and number of deaths; establishing and maintaining leading market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships; effectively responding to increasing cremation trends by selling complementary services and merchandise; controlling salary, merchandise and other controllable costs; exercising pricing leverage related to our atneed business to increase average revenue per contract; and our response to fluctuations in capital markets and interest rates, which affect investment earnings on trust funds, which would offset lower pricing power as preneed contracts mature. In simple terms, volume and price are the two variables that affect funeral revenue. The average revenue per contract is influenced by the mix of traditional and cremation services because our average cremation service revenue is approximately one-third of the average revenue earned from a traditional burial service. Funeral homes have a relatively fixed cost structure.\nCemetery Operations\nFactors affecting our cemetery operating results include: the size and success of our sales organization; local perceptions and heritage of our cemeteries; our ability to adapt to changes in the economy and consumer confidence; and our response to fluctuations in capital markets and interest rates, which affect investment earnings on trust funds, finance charges on installment contracts and our securities portfolio within the trust funds.\nInflationary and Macroeconomic Trends\nDuring 2023, we continued to experience cost increases from our vendors and suppliers on merchandise and goods due to increases in the cost of raw materials, as well as inflationary impacts and rising interest rates. For example, we experienced higher costs related to full-time hourly base rates, utilities, funeral supplies, merchandise costs, insurance, and increased borrowing costs due to higher variable interest rates under our Credit Facility. Although we have taken steps to mitigate these cost increases and we expect these impacts to continue throughout the next year, the ultimate scope and duration of these impacts are unknown at this time. More broadly, the U.S. economy continues to experience higher rates of inflation, which has impacted a wide variety of industries and sectors, with consumers facing rising prices. Such inflation may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending, including the amount that consumers are able to spend on our services, although we have not experienced any material impacts to date and our industry has been largely resilient to similar adverse economic and market environments in the past. Although we expect these trends to continue throughout the next year, we will continue to assess these impacts and take the appropriate steps, if necessary, to mitigate these cost increases, if possible.\nDuring 2023, we experienced lower volumes as compared to prior years due to fluctuations in the death rate, although overall financial performance remains at or above prior reporting periods. Although we expect fluctuations in the death rate to continue, we are unable to predict or forecast the duration or variation of the death rate with any certainty. Regardless of these fluctuations in the death rate, we continue to focus on expanding market share, cost management and executing on our strategic operational plans.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flows from operating activities and availability under our Credit Facility (defined below).\nWe generate cash in our operations primarily from atneed sales and delivery of preneed sales. We also generate cash from earnings on our cemetery perpetual care trusts. Based on our recent operating results, current cash position and anticipated future cash flows, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future. We have the ability to draw on our Credit Facility, subject to its customary terms and conditions. However, if our capital allocations and expenditures or acquisition plans change, we may need to access the capital markets or seek further borrowing capacity from our lenders to obtain additional funding and we may not be able to obtain such funding on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us. Further, to the extent operating cash flow or access to and cost of financing sources are materially different than expected, future liquidity may be adversely affected. For additional information regarding known material factors that could cause cash flow or access to and cost of finance sources to differ from our expectations, please read Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nFor 2024, our plan is to remain focused on integrating our recently acquired business and prioritizing our capital allocation for debt repayments, the payment of dividends and debt obligations and internal growth capital expenditures, which we expect to fund using cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Facility, along with general corporate purposes, as allowed under our Credit Facility. We believe that our existing and anticipated cash resources, including, as needed, additional borrowings or other financings that we may be able to obtain, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled debt payments, commitments and dividends for the next 12 months, as well as our long-term financial obligations.\nCash Flows\nWe began 2023 with $1.2 million in cash and ended the year with $1.5 million in cash. At December 31, 2023, we had borrowings of $179.1 million outstanding on our Credit Facility compared to $190.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and $155.4 million as of December 31, 2021.\nThe following table sets forth the elements of cash flow (in thousands):\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was $75.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $84.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe increase of $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to an $8.6 million withdrawal of realized capital gains and earnings from our preneed funeral and cemetery trust investments and receiving a $6.0 million incentive payment from a vendor related to a strategic partnership agreement to market and sell prearranged funeral services. The decrease of $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to the unfavorable working capital changes in accrued liabilities, which were partially offset by favorable changes in income tax receivables.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired a business consisting of three funeral homes, two cemeteries and one cremation focused business for $44.0 million and real estate for $3.1 million of which $0.5 million was paid in cash and the remainder financed over fifteen years. In addition, we sold two funeral homes and two cemeteries for an aggregate of $1.1 million and real estate for $3.1 million.\nWe also received proceeds of $1.4 million from our property insurance policy for the reimbursement of renovation costs for certain of our funeral businesses damaged by Hurricane Ian that occurred during the third quarter of 2022 and a fire that occurred during the first quarter of 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired a business consisting of two funeral homes in Kissimmee, FL for $6.3 million in cash and a business consisting of three funeral homes, one cemetery and one cremation focused business in the Charlotte, NC area for $25.0 million in cash. In addition, we sold four funeral homes for $1.5 million, sold real estate for $3.3 million and purchased real estate for $2.6 million. We also received proceeds of $2.4 million from our property insurance policy for the reimbursement of renovation costs for our funeral and cemetery businesses that were damaged by Hurricane Ida.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold two funeral homes and one cemetery for $2.5 million, sold real estate for $5.2 million and purchased real estate for $3.3 million. We also received proceeds of $7.8 million from our property insurance policy for the reimbursement of renovation costs for our funeral and cemetery businesses that were damaged by Hurricane Ida.\nCapital Expenditures\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our capital expenditures (comprised of growth and maintenance spend) totaled $18.0 million compared to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe following tables present our growth and maintenance capital expenditures (in thousands):\n(1) During the year ended December 31, 2023, we spent $0.8 million for renovations to two businesses that were affected by Hurricane Ian, which occurred during the third quarter of 2022 and $0.4 million for renovations to one business that was damaged by a fire, which occurred during the first quarter of 2023, all of which was reimbursed by our property insurance.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we spent $2.4 million for renovations on two businesses that were affected by Hurricane Ida, all of which was reimbursed by our property insurance.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we spent $1.6 million for renovations on four businesses that were affected by Hurricane Ida, all of which was reimbursed by our property insurance.\nFinancing Activities\nOur financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to a net cash outflow of $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and a net cash outflow of $71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had net payments on our Credit Facility, acquisition debt and finance leases of $12.8 million and paid dividends of $6.7 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net borrowings on our Credit Facility, acquisition debt and finance leases of $34.4 million, offset by the following payments: i) $36.7 million for the purchase of treasury stock; ii) $6.8 million in dividends; and iii) $0.9 million for debt issuance and transactions costs related to our Credit Facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net borrowings on our Credit Facility, acquisition debt and finance leases of $106.9 million, offset by the following payments: i) $19.9 million for the call premium to redeem our 6.625% senior notes due 2026; ii) $140.0 million for the purchase of treasury stock; iii) $2.2 million for debt issuance and transactions costs related to our 4.25% senior notes due 2029 and Credit Facility; iv) $4.0 million for the conversions and maturity of our 2.75% convertible subordinated notes; and v) $7.3 million in dividends.\nDividends\nOur Board declared the following dividends payable on the dates below (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nShare Repurchases\nSubject to market conditions, normal trading restrictions and satisfying certain financial covenants in our Credit Facility, and in the Indenture governing our Senior Notes, we may make purchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under our Board authorized share repurchase program, in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nOn February 23, 2022, our Board authorized an increase in our share repurchase program to permit us to purchase up to an additional $75.0 million under our share repurchase program, in addition to amounts previously authorized and outstanding in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, which totaled up to $265.0 million in share repurchase authorizations.\nShare repurchase activity is as follows (dollar value of shares repurchased in thousands):\n(1) These amounts may differ from the repurchases of common stock amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to unsettled share repurchases at the end of a period. In December 2021, we repurchased 37,408 shares for $2.4 million, the settlement of which occurred in January 2022.\nOur shares were purchased in the open market at times and in amounts as management determined appropriate based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements and other business considerations. Shares purchased pursuant to the repurchase program are currently held as treasury stock. At December 31, 2023, our share repurchase program had $48.9 million authorized for repurchases.\nCredit Facility, Lease Obligations and Acquisition Debt\nThe outstanding principal of our Credit Facility, lease obligations and acquisition debt at December 31, 2023 is as follows (in thousands):\nCredit Facility\nAt December 31, 2023, our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) was comprised of: (i) a $250.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $15.0 million subfacility for letters of credit and a $10.0 million swingline, and (ii) an accordion or incremental option allowing for future increases in the facility size by an additional amount of up to $75.0 million in the aggregate in the form of increased revolving commitments or incremental term loans. The final maturity of the Credit Facility will occur on May 13, 2026.\nOur obligations under the Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the same subsidiaries which guarantee the Senior Notes (as defined in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) and certain of our subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”).\nThe Credit Facility contains customary affirmative covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants with respect to the use of proceeds, payment of taxes and other obligations, continuation of the Company’s business and the maintenance of existing rights and privileges, the maintenance of property and insurance, among others.\nIn addition, the Credit Facility also contains customary negative covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict (subject to certain exceptions) the ability of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, and pay dividends and other restricted payments, and certain financial maintenance covenants. At December 31, 2023, we were subject to the following financial covenants under our Credit Facility: (A) a Total Leverage Ratio not to exceed 5.75 to 1.00 and (B) a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of not less than 1.20 to 1.00 as of the end of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. These financial maintenance covenants are calculated for the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. We were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our Credit Facility at December 31, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $179.1 million. We also had one letter of credit for $2.3 million under the Credit Facility, which was increased to $2.6 million on July 7, 2023. The letter of credit will expire on November 27, 2024 and is expected to automatically renew annually and secures our obligations under our various self-insured policies. At December 31, 2023, we had $68.3 million of availability under the Credit Facility.\nOutstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest at a prime rate or a BSBY rate, plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2023, the prime rate margin was equivalent to 2.375% and the BSBY rate margin was 3.375%. The weighted average interest rate on our Credit Facility was 4.0% and 8.6% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nWe have no material assets or operations independent of the Subsidiary Guarantors, as all of our assets and operations are held and conducted by the Subsidiary Guarantors. Additionally, we do not currently have any significant restrictions on our ability to receive dividends or loans from any Subsidiary Guarantors.\nThe interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our Credit Facility are as follows (in thousands):\nThe interest payments on our remaining borrowings under the Credit Facility will be determined based on the average outstanding balance of our borrowings and the prevailing interest rate during that time. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our debt and interest payments.\nLease Obligations\nOur lease obligations consist of operating and finance leases. We lease certain office facilities, certain funeral homes, vehicles and equipment under operating leases with original terms ranging from one to twenty years. Many leases include one or more options to renew, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to forty years. We lease certain funeral homes, vehicles and equipment under finance leases with original terms ranging from three and a half to forty years.\nThe components of lease cost are as follows (in thousands):\nAt December 31, 2023, non-cancelable operating and finance lease obligations were $35.9 million with $5.4 million payable within 12 months. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our lease payments.\nAcquisition Debt\nAcquisition debt consists of deferred purchase price and promissory notes payable to sellers. A majority of the deferred purchase price and notes bear no interest and are discounted at imputed interest rates ranging from 6.5% to 7.3%. Original maturities typically range from five to twenty years.\nThe imputed interest expense related to our acquisition debt is as follows (in thousands):\nAt December 31, 2023, acquisition debt obligations were $9.3 million, with $0.9 million payable within 12 months. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our debt payments.\nConvertible Subordinated Notes due 2021\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we converted $2.4 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2021 (the “Convertible Notes”) held by certain holders for $3.8 million in cash and recorded $1.4 million for the reacquisition of the equity component. The Convertible Notes matured on March 15, 2021, at which time all Convertible Notes outstanding, $0.2 million in aggregate principal amount, were paid in full in cash at par value. Therefore, no Convertible Notes remain outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nThe interest expense and accretion of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our Convertible Notes are as follows (in thousands):\nThe effective interest rate on the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 3.1%.\nSenior Notes\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”) and related guarantees by the Subsidiary Guarantors, which were issued in a private offering under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act.\nThe Senior Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of May 13, 2021 (the “Indenture”), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (“Collateral Trustee”). The Senior Notes are unsecured, senior obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally by each of the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Senior Notes mature on May 15, 2029, unless earlier redeemed or purchased and bear interest at 4.25% per year, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2021.\nWe may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption price of 102.13% on or after May 15, 2024, 101.06% on or after May 15, 2025 and 100% on or after May 15, 2026, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time before May 15, 2024, we may also redeem all or part of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices described in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the date of redemption. In addition, before May 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes outstanding using an amount of cash equal to the net proceeds of certain equity offerings, at a price of 104.25% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the date of redemption; provided that (1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (including any additional Senior Notes) outstanding under the Indenture remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (unless all Senior Notes are redeemed concurrently), and (2) each such redemption must occur within 180 days of the date of the consummation of any such equity offering.\nIf a “change of control” occurs, holders of the Senior Notes will have the option to require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if we make certain asset sales and do not reinvest the proceeds thereof or use such proceeds to repay certain debt, we will be required to use the proceeds of such asset sales to make an offer to purchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe Indenture contains restrictive covenants limiting our ability and our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares, create liens on certain assets to secure debt, pay dividends or make other equity distributions, purchase or redeem capital stock, make certain investments, sell assets, agree to certain restrictions on the ability of Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments to us, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The Indenture also contains customary events of default.\nThe debt discount and the debt issuance costs are being amortized using the effective interest method over the remaining term of 65 months of the Senior Notes. The effective interest rate on the unamortized debt discount and the unamortized debt issuance costs for the Senior Notes for both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 was 4.42% and 4.30%, respectively.\nThe fair value of the Senior Notes, which are Level 2 measurements, was $355.4 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe interest expense and amortization of debt discount, debt premium and debt issuance costs related to our Senior Notes are as follows (in thousands):\nWe have future interest payments on our outstanding balance of $93.5 million, with $17.0 million payable within 12 months. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our debt and interest payments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2023, our off-balance sheet arrangements were as follows:\nNon-compete agreements - We have various non-compete agreements with former owners and employees of businesses we have acquired. These agreements are generally for one to ten years and provide for periodic payments over the term of the agreements. We have future payments on our non-compete agreements of $7.7 million, with $2.3 million payable within 12 months.\nConsulting agreements - We have various consulting agreements with former owners of businesses we have acquired. Payments for such agreements are generally not made in advance. These agreements are generally for one to five years and provide for bi-weekly or monthly payments. We have future payments on our consulting agreements of $2.2 million, with $0.9 million payable within 12 months.\nEmployment agreements - We have employment agreements with our executive officers. These agreements are generally for three to six years and provide for participation in various incentive compensation arrangements. These agreements generally renew automatically on an annual basis after their initial term has expired. We have future payments on our employment agreements of $13.3 million, with $5.5 million payable within 12 months.\nIn connection with Mr. Payne’s transition from Executive Chairman of the Board to serving as a special advisor to the Board, his employment agreement with the Company was terminated and he entered into a transition agreement, effective February 22, 2024. For more information on this transition see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 24 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLetter of credit - We have one letter of credit for $2.6 million under the Credit Facility, which secures our obligations under our various self-insurance policies in the event we are unable to meet the self-insurance portion of our claim payment obligations. As we already have reserves recorded for our self-insurance claims costs, these do not represent additional liabilities. The letter of credit will expire on November 27, 2024 and is expected to automatically renew annually.\nThe obligations related to our off-balance sheet arrangements are significant to our future liquidity; however, although we can provide no assurances, we anticipate that these obligations will be funded from cash provided from our operating activities. If we are not able to meet these obligations with cash provided by our operating activities, we may be required to access the capital markets or draw down on our Credit Facility, both of which may be more difficult to access. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 12 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our letter of credit and off-balance sheet agreements, respectively.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nBelow are our financial highlights (in thousands except for volumes and averages):\nRevenue in 2023 increased $12.3 million compared to 2022, primarily as a result of a 9.4% increase in the average price per preneed interment right sold, an 8.6% increase in the number of preneed interment rights (property) sold and a 0.9% increase in the average revenue per funeral contract, offset by a 2.4% decrease in the funeral contract volume. The funeral contract volume decrease is primarily a result of the lower impact of COVID-19 related deaths in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022.\nRevenue in 2022 decreased $5.7 million compared to 2021, primarily as a result of a 3.6% decrease in funeral contract volume, a 4.6% decrease in the number of preneed interment rights (property) sold and a 3.0% decrease in the average price per interment right sold, which were slightly offset by a 2.5% increase in average revenue per funeral contract. The decrease in funeral contract volume and the number of interment rights sold correspond to the decline in COVID-19 related cases in 2022 compared to 2021, as deaths directly attributable from COVID-19 largely decreased during that period to have minimal impact on the overall death rate. Further discussion of revenue for our funeral home and cemetery segments is presented under “Results of Operations.”\nGross profit in 2023 increased $5.1 million compared to 2022, primarily due to the increase in revenue from our cemetery segment, offset by an increase in operating expenses in our cemetery segment.\nGross profit in 2022 decreased $10.3 million compared to 2021, due to the decrease in revenue, as well as increases in operating expenses, in both our funeral and cemetery segments. These increases are partially due to higher costs from inflationary impacts concentrated in our full-time hourly base rates, utilities, funeral supplies, and merchandise costs. Further discussion of the components of gross profit for our funeral home and cemetery segments, is presented under “Results of Operations.”\nNet income in 2023 decreased $8.0 million compared to 2022, primarily due to the following: (1) a $10.4 million increase in interest expense; (2) a $4.7 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses; and (3) a $1.0 million increase in divestitures, disposals, impairment charges and insurance reimbursements, offset by (4) the increase in gross profit of $5.1 million; and (5) a $2.8 million decrease in tax expense.\nNet income in 2022 increased $8.2 million compared to 2021, primarily due to the following: (1) a $23.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2021; (2) a $3.5 million gain on insurance reimbursements in 2022, offset by (3) the decrease in gross profit of $10.3 million; (4) a $4.7 million increase in tax expense; (5) a $2.3 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses; and (6) a $1.4 million decrease in net loss on divestitures, disposals and impairments charges.\nFurther discussion of general, administrative and other expenses, net loss on divestitures, disposals and impairment charges, interest expense, income taxes and other components of income and expenses are presented under “Other Financial Statement Items.”\nREPORTING AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe also present our financial performance in our “Condensed Operating and Financial Trend Report” (“Trend Report”) as reported in our earnings release for the year ending December 31, 2023, dated February 21, 2024, and discussed in the corresponding earnings conference call. This Trend Report is used as a supplemental financial statement by management and investors to compare our current financial performance with our previous results and with the performance of other companies. We do not intend for this information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Trend Report is a non-GAAP statement that also provides insight into underlying trends in our business.\nBelow is a reconciliation of gross profit (a GAAP financial measure) to operating profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) (in thousands):\n(1) Operating profit is defined as gross profit plus cemetery property amortization, field depreciation expense and regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs.\nOur operations are reported in two business segments: Funeral Home and Cemetery. Below is a breakdown of operating profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) by Segment (in thousands):\n(1) Operating profit margin is defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue.\nFurther discussion of operating profit for our funeral home and cemetery segments is presented under “Results of Operations.”\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe term “operating” in the Funeral Home and Cemetery segments refers to all funeral homes and cemeteries that we owned and operated in the current reporting period, excluding certain funeral home and cemetery businesses that we have divested in such period.\nThe term “divested” when discussed in the Funeral Home segment, refers to two funeral home we sold during the year ended December 31, 2023 and two funeral homes we sold during the year ended December 31, 2022. The term “divested” when discussed in the Cemetery segment, refers to two cemeteries we sold during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe term “ancillary” in the Funeral Home segment represents our flower shop, monument business, pet cremation business and online cremation businesses.\nCemetery property amortization, field depreciation expense and regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs, are not included in operating profit, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adding back these items will result in gross profit, a GAAP financial measure.\nFuneral Home Segment\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our revenue and operating profit for our funeral home operations (in thousands):\nFuneral home operating revenue decreased $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in operating revenue is primarily driven by a 2.4% decrease in contract volume, which was partially offset by a 1.0% increase in the average revenue per contract excluding preneed interest. The contract volume decrease is primarily a result of the significant decline in COVID-19 related deaths in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, as these deaths now have a minimal impact on the overall death rate. The increase in average revenue per contract is primarily due to a combination of price increases and our continued focus on educating families on the many products and service options that are available with burials and cremations.\nFuneral home operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased $7.0 million when compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The comparable operating profit margin decreased 250 basis points to 38.1%. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 2.4%, with the largest increases in salary and benefits expenses of 1.3%, general and administrative expenses of 0.4%, facilities and grounds expenses of 0.4% and other funeral costs of 0.3%. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to our Bakersfield, CA business acquired during the first quarter of 2023. As we continue to integrate this business into our Standards Operating Model, we expect to see their operating expenses as a percentage of revenue become more consistent with our remaining portfolio of businesses.\nAncillary revenue, which represents revenue from our flower shop, monument business, pet cremation business and online cremation businesses increased $0.4 million, while ancillary operating profit decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in revenue is primarily due to our Bakersfield, CA business acquired during the first quarter of 2023, as it was not present in the comparative period of 2022. Similarly, the decrease in operating profit is primarily due to this same business, as its operating profit margins were lower compared to our other ancillary businesses, particularly with regard to higher salaries and benefits expenses.\nOther revenue and other operating profit, which consist of preneed funeral insurance commissions and preneed funeral trust earnings, both increased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the recognition of additional general agency commission revenue in 2023 as we entered into an exclusive partnership agreement with a national insurance provider to market and sell prearranged funeral services in the future.\nCemetery Segment\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our revenue and operating profit for our cemetery operations (in thousands):\nCemetery operating revenue increased $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a 9.4% increase in the average price per preneed interment right sold, as well as an 8.6% increase in preneed interment rights sold. Cemetery atneed revenue, which represents 37.0% of our total operating revenue, increased $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to an increase in sales of merchandise and services from our newly acquired cemetery businesses, which were not present in the year ended 2022.\nCemetery operating profit increased $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in operating profit is primarily due to the increase in operating revenue, offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The comparable operating profit margin decreased 150 basis point to 40.2%. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue increased 1.5%, with the largest increases in salary and benefits expenses of 0.8% and promotional expenses, which includes sales commissions, of 0.8%.\nOther revenue and other operating profit, which consist of preneed cemetery trust revenue and preneed cemetery finance charges, both increased $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in perpetual care trust fund income and a $0.2 million increase in finance charges on preneed sales.\nCemetery property amortization.

Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which our management uses judgment, assumptions and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our critical accounting policies are more fully described in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1.\nWe have identified the following accounting policies as those that require significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and that have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These policies are considered critical because they may result in fluctuations in our reported results from period to period due to the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions about complex and inherently uncertain matters and because the use of different judgments, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. Historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance because there can be no assurance the margins, operating income and net earnings, as a percentage of revenue, will be consistent from period to period. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions.\nGoodwill\nOur quantitative goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment. In the quantitative analysis, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We determine fair value for each reporting unit using both an income approach, weighted 90%, and a market approach, weighted 10%. Our methodology for determining an income-based fair value is based on discounting projected future cash flows. The discounted cash flow valuation uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual future cash flows. Our methodology for determining a market approach fair value utilizes the guideline public company method, in which we rely on market multiples of comparable companies operating in the same industry as the individual reporting units. In accordance with the guidance, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to the difference.\nSee Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4 for additional information related to goodwill.\nBusiness Combinations\nDetermining the fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles and liabilities acquired also requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. To the extent that information not available to us at the closing date subsequently becomes available during the allocation period, we may adjust goodwill, intangible assets, assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition.\nWhen we acquire a cemetery, we utilize an internal and external approach to determine the fair value of the cemetery property. From an external perspective, we obtain an accredited appraisal to provide reasonable assurance for property existence, property availability (unrestricted) for development, property lines, available spaces to sell, identifiable obstacles or easements and general valuation inclusive of known variables in that market. From an internal perspective, we conduct a detailed analysis of the acquired cemetery property using other cemeteries in our portfolio as a benchmark. This provides the added benefit of relevant data that is not available to third party appraisers. Through this thorough internal process, the Company is able to identify viable costs of property based on historical experience, particular markets and demographics, reasonable margins, practical retail prices and park infrastructure and condition.\nSee Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 for additional information related to business combinations.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND OTHER REGULATIONS\nFor discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and accounting changes, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2."
